# gbce (GameBoy Color Emulator) 

`gbce` is a GameBoy color emulator. Ironically, at the time of writing,
it only emulates original GameBoy games. `gbce` is not actively maintained, and 
was just a side project developed for fun. Bugs may be present during emulation.

To run, a file called `gb_bios.bin` must be placed in the `files/` directory.
